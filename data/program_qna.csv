"What is a queue in programming?","A queue is a data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle for adding and removing elements."
"What is the difference between a stack and a queue?","A stack uses LIFO, where the last item added is the first to be removed, while a queue uses FIFO, where the first item added is the first to be removed."
